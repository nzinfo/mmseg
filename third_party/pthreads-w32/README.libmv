Upstream version: 2.8.0 from ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe
Local modifications: 

* Added #include <pthread.h> to implement.h. I have no idea why it wasn't there
  already.
* The files are split across include/ and src/, which is not the case in the
  upstream source distribution

Note that I didn't check in the pristine version by accident; however it should be easy to make a diff for implement.h.
